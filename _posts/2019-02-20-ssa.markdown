After reading "engineering a compiler", i think i get the idear of SSA. So i
decided to write down some notes, otherwise i'll forget that.

# What is SSA?

# How to transform SSA ?
## Find DF(Dominate frontier) of nodes
TODO

## Insert phi function
TODO

## Rename variables
TODO

## Convert back from SSA form
TODO

# Why SSA?
(Maybe this section should be place in front.)
Because if not, then there maybe some redefine variables, some we have to handle
the shadow variables, so the value-environment is not flat, it's level inside
level, which makes addressing complicated and inefficient.
So, if we are finding/updating variables so frequently, then we do a transform
it into SSA once and for all, then all the steps after, will benifit from it by
simplifying addressing variables.
And it can simplify liveness analys and register allocation.
